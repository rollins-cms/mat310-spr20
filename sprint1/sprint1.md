# Sprint 1: Formal Languages and Finite State Machines

# Roadmap:
* Teams
* Sprint Duration: Wed. Jan 29 - Wed. Feb. 12
* Quiz date/time: Wed. Feb. 12th at the beginning of class
* Requirements due: 
    * Problem set on Mon. Feb. 10th at the end of class
    * Regular Expressions lab writeup on Wed. Feb. 12th at the start of class.

# Rationale: 
Sprint 1 will show us how simple computational machines can work.  We will need some formal tools to help us logically approach basic computational principles: regular expressions, regular languages, and finite automata.  Our goal is to be able to be able to take a special subclass of languages (called regular languages) and understand how a computer could recognize and programatically work with them.  We'll also play around with what programmers call "regular expressions" which are (related but) different from the formal language descriptors. 

# Responsibilities (What you need to know):
1. Languages
   * Alphabet
   * Symbols
   * Strings or words
   * regular languages
 2. Finite Automata (or Finite State Machines)
    * state diagrams - be able to draw
       * accept and final states
       * transitions
 3. Regular operations
    * Union
    * Concatenation
    * Kleene star (or just "star")
 4. Regular expressions
    * formal definition
    * equivalence with FSA
    
# Requirements (What you need to do):
1. The requirements grade is the problem set and lab answers.  The Scrumage grade is assessed separately via your Trello board, SCRUM artifacts and standup meetings.

## Individual Requirements:
   * Understand the concepts on the Responsibilities list
   * Complete the [regular expressions](./lab-regex.md) lab and prepare a document with the answers to the questions in the lab.

## Team Requirements:
   * Set up a shared board with this sprint's requirements (add me to your board - Trello ID: valeriesummet)
   * Complete this problem set: [PDF with space for answers](./sprint1_prob_set_space.pdf) or [PDF with only the questions](./sprint1_prob_set_nospace.pdf)
   
# Resources:  
I may add to these as we go through the sprint.  Use the [Expert Request](https://rollins.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0jNfbBpN1clDJfn?course=mat310s20&sprint=1) for more resources. 
   * Textbook readings: These readings cover the same topics, but do so in a different order and use slightly different notations in some cases.  You can read either or both.  My recommendation is that your team pick on or the other and use the 2nd as an extra resource.  In my opinion, FoC is a bit easier to understand, but ITC is more complete.
      * ITC: 0.1, pgs 13-14 (langauges and strings section), Chapter 1.1, 1.3 (omit proofs in *Equivalence with Finite Automata* section on pages 66-76; it's enough to know they are equivalent)
      * FoC: Chapter 3.1-3.4
   * Easy-to-use, [online tool](http://madebyevan.com/fsm/) for drawing FSA
   * [Practice quiz](./sprint1_practice_quiz.pdf) and [answer key](./sprint1_practice_quiz_ans.pdf)
   * [Video overview of DFA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yh3FLKgAGQ) (YouTube, 12 mins) - Includes formal definition of a DFA, how to write a transition table, and a simple example of a DFA for a specific language
   * [Video overview of (mathematical) regular expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qGPpeVZvdM)  There is a bit of extra information in this video, including the + notation.  It also uses the traditional union symbol instead of the vertical bar, `|`, as your textbook does.  This isn't uncommon as you will see the union operation expressed in several different ways in regular expressions.  I usually use the vertical bar.

# Reality Check:
  * On Wednesday 1/29, do previous sprint retrospective and sprint planning meeting.  Skim problem set to give some context for your readings.
  * TODO by next class:  Enter deliverables on Trello, categorize them.  Assign topics and responsibilities.  Read and work through textbook readings.  Skim problem set.
  * Monday class 2/3: File expert requests for Wednesday or next Monday.  Discuss and begin problem set as a group.
  * TODO by next class: Complete rough draft of most of problem set.  
  * Wednesday 2/5: Check problems in class, continue work on problem set.  Start regular experssion lab.
  * TODO by Monday: Have "almost final" answers for all problems in problem set.  Some may still need group discussion or further clarification.
  * Monday 2/10: Do final check of problem set.  Make sure problem set is neat, tidy, and meets guidelines.  Turn in your problem set at the end of class. 
  * TODO before next class: Finish regular expressions lab and writeup your answers.  Take the practice quiz and check your answers.  Study as a group.  
  * Wednesday 2/12: Quiz (30 minutes), Sprint 1 retrospective, and Sprint 2 planning.

# Retrospective:
  * Complete this [sprint retrospective survey](https://rollins.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3rAIzhpHFYbIixf?course=mat310s20&sprint=1).  Each team member should complete a survey.
