# Sprint 5: Boolean Logic and Circuits

# Roadmap:
* Teams
* Sprint Duration: 
* Quiz date/time: Monday, 4/27- Tuesday, 4/28
* Requirements due: Monday, 4/27

# Rationale: 
We've spent a lot of time on theoretical computing machines.  Now we're going to circle back around to the start of our exploration.  How are these computing machines actually built?  What sorts of hardware allow us to make the transition from the mathematical world to the physical computing world?  We'll explore logic gates and see how to put together some very basic building blocks to build sophisticated computing machines. 

# Responsibilities (What you need to know):
1. Basic gates -- logic and representation
   * AND
   * OR
   * NOT
   * NAND
2. Be able to draw circuits from compound propositions and vice versa.
3. Use truth tables to compute the output of a circuit and express it in disjunctive normal form
4. Simplify circuits using laws of Boolean algebra
5. Construct and simplify circuits made from universal NAND gates
6. Understand timing diagrams

# Requirements (What you need to do):

## Individual Requirements:
   * Contribute to your team and tracking team deliverables
   * Understand all the learning responsibilties

## Team Requirements:
   * Maintain a Trello board for deliverables
   * Complete the team problem set
   
# Resources:  
I may add to these as we go through the sprint.  Use the [Expert Request](https://rollins.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0jNfbBpN1clDJfn?course=mat310s20&sprint=5) for more resources. 
   * [Computation and Logic Gates Video](https://rollins.kanopy.com/video/computation-and-logic-gates) -- Professional video covering Logic.  The first 10 minutes are history which are interesting and fun, but not a learning goal for this sprint.  So just sit back and enjoy that part.  The next 20 minutes cover all the way from logic gates to flip-flops.  The only drawback is that he doesn't use the standard gate notation.
   * FoC - 1.3  (There is not a section on logic gates in IToC)
   * [Worked Example of Circuit Simplification](./worked_example-simplification.pdf)
   * [Easy Circuit Simulation Website](https://sciencedemos.org.uk/logic_gates.php)
   * Videos on Canvas: Universal NAND gates (11 min), Timing Diagrams (6 min)
   
# Retrospective:
  * Complete this [sprint retrospective survey](https://rollins.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3rAIzhpHFYbIixf?course=mat310s20&sprint=5).  Each team member should complete a survey.
