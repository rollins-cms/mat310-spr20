# Sprint 4 Problem Set

1. Complete this (easy and straightforward) [exercise](./ex1/ex1.md) using this JFLAP file [exercise1.jff](./ex1/exercise1.jff)
2. Often we think of TMs not so much as acceptors of languages as computers of functions. The input to the function is the initial content of the tape and the output is the final content of the tape when the TM reaches an accepting state.

This TM computes a well known operation on a bit string.

To get a better understanding of what it does and how it operates, we can record the computational details
for a typical input string.
To begin, we write the input string 011 onto the tape of the Turing machine, position the
read/write head at the first symbol, and set the current state to q0, the initial state of the Turing
machine. This is shown pictorially:
![Tape one](./images/bit_op_tape_1.PNG)

All other squares have blanks. At each step of the computation, the machine has a current
state and the read/write head is positioned under one of the squares of the tape.

From this point on, the transitions of the Turing machine dictate what happens to the current
state, the read/write head, and the tape content. In this example, since the current state is q0
and the symbol under the read/write head is 0, the transition 0; X, L applies. This updates the
current state (changing from q0 to q1), overwrites the 0 with X, and moves the read/write head one
position left:

   a.  Determine the remaining sequence of actions for this input string, using the tape diagrams above as a guide (although you do not draw the tape each time). Each time the Turing machine makes a transition, record the tape content, the current state, and the position of the read/write head. This will take some patience, since an input of just three bits requires more than 30 transitions of the given Turing machine. You should discover that eventually the Turing machine will reach state q6, at which point it halts since there are no transitions which apply in that state.
   
   b.  Describe (in your own words) how the TM works (see exercise 1 for a good description based on the Church-Turing thesis).

2. Using JFLAP, construct (and test!) a machine that reads in an input string over the alphabet {a,b} and halts with the cell the read/write head points to containing 1 if the input's length is odd and a â–¡ (blank) otherwise. For example, if "aabba" is on the tape when the machine starts, the read/write head should point to a cell containing 1 when the machine halts. I don't care what else is on the tape when the machine halts.
3. One fun thing you can do with a Turing Machine is to send it into an infinte loop. The following machine halts if its input begins with a, and goes into an infinite loop otherwise. I mean, it's one way of showing that you don't like a string. You can think of it as throwing a tantrum.

Use JFLAP to construct (and test!) a machine that halts when its input is a palindrome over {a,b} and goes into an infinite loop otherwise. What you leave on the tape is up to you.
