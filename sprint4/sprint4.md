# Reality Check:
  * On Tuesday, do basic team setup and introductions.  Do sprint planning meeting.  Work on syllabus worksheet.
  * TODO by next class:  Get Trello accounts and do Scrum reading. Skim worksheet and problem set, noting problems you have no idea where to start or are confused by.
  * Thursday class: Make sure everyone's on Trello.  Discuss the definitions of Scrum if there are any questions. Enter deliverables on Trello, categorize them into In-Progress and Backlog, and assign topics based on topics you had issues with.
  * TODO by next class: Read and work through textbook readings.  Do worksheet(s), focusing on areas you're having trouble with.  Complete the syllabus quiz.
  * Tuesday: Check worksheet and syllabus quiz & make sure everyone understands. Start problem sets together. Check/Ask professor for help if you're stuck.  Play game together.
  * TODO by Thursday: Have "almost final" answers for all problems in problem set.  Some may still need group discussion or further clarification.
  * Thursday: Do final check of problem set.  Make sure problem set is neat, tidy, and meets guidelines.  Turn in your problem set at the end of class.
  * TODO before next class: Play review game if you haven't alreay. Take the practice quiz and check your answers.  Study as a group.  
  * Next Tuesday: Quiz (30 minutes), Sprint XXX retrospective, and Sprint XXX planning.

# Retrospective:
  * Complete this [sprint retrospective survey](https://rollins.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3rAIzhpHFYbIixf?course=mat310s20&sprint=4).  Each team member should complete a survey.
