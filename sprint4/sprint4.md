# Sprint 4: Turing Machines

# Roadmap:
* Teams
* Sprint Duration: Wed. March 11 - Wed. Apr. 1
* Quiz date/time:  Wed. Apr. 1 at the beginning of class
* Requirements due: Wed. Apr. 1 at the beginning of class.

# Rationale:
When we studied DFAs and NFAs, we saw that the lack of "memory" prevented us from being able to work with certain languages.  Then we took a step farther and saw that CFGs could handle still more languages.  We've now come to Turing Machines.  Turing Machines introduce a bi-directional tape which serves as both input and output.  It's a really simple little machine, but as we'll see, it's amazingly powerful -- equivalent to modern computers.  There's a reason why Alan Turing is referred to as the "Father of Computer Science" and his paper on these machines is why.  Turing machines are one of the most important formal models in the study of computer science.


# Responsibilities (What you need to know):
1. Understand formal definition.
2. Given a formal definition of a TM, be able to draw the state machine
3. Be able to trace a TMs states and tape for a particular input tape
4. Understand duality of TMs: as a decider and as a computer (of functions)
5. Understand the implications of the Church-Turing thesis
6. Be able to state intuitively how to construct a TM to solve a specific problem
7. Use JFLAP to construct, test, and modify TMs

# Requirements (What you need to do):
Complete the problem set as a team.  Scrumage grades will be assessed separ

## Individual Requirements:
   * Participate in your team and understand the responsibilities above

## Team Requirements:
   * Track deliverables via a team Trello board (share with valeriesummet)
   * Complete the [problem set](./problem_set.md)
   
# Resources:  
I may add to these as we go through the sprint.  Use the [Expert Request](https://rollins.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0jNfbBpN1clDJfn?course=mat310s20&sprint=4) for more resources. 
   * Textbook:
       * FoC - Ch 4
       * IToC - Ch 3.1, Intro to 3.3 (through Church-Turing thesis)
   * [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZS_zFg4w5k) (YouTube, 9min)explaining Turing's original paper on Turing Machines and why it was so revolutionary
   * [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJQTFhkhwPA) (YouTube, 4min) of Turing Machine automaton.
   * Video on Canvas: Introduction to JFLAP (12 min); formal definition of TMs (8 min)
   * [Download JFLAP7.1.jar](http://www.jflap.org/jflaptmp/july27-18/JFLAP7.1.jar) - Save this `.jar` file somewhere which is easy to access.  If you already have Java installed (as most of you do...) double-clicking the `.jar` file should start JFLAP.
   * [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGLQiHXHWNk) (YouTube, 6 min) - The Halting Problem (undeciable problems)
   * [JFLAP tutorial](http://www.jflap.org/tutorial/) (specifically the Turing Machine section)
   
   
# Retrospective:
  * Complete this [sprint retrospective survey](https://rollins.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3rAIzhpHFYbIixf?course=mat310s20&sprint=4).  Each team member should complete a survey.
