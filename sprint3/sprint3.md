# Sprint 3: Context Free Grammars, Lexical Analysis, and Parsing

# Roadmap:
* Teams
* Sprint Duration: Feb. 26 - Mar. 11
* Quiz date/time: Mar. 11 at the start of class
* Requirements due: Problem set due Mar. 9 at the end of class.

# Rationale: 
We saw in Sprint 2 that there were some languages which were non-regular and thus couldn't be modeled with DFAs, NFAs, or regular expressions.  In this sprint, we'll look at a class of languages called **context-free languages** which can be generated with **context-free grammars**.  Grammars are the rules by which we generate a language -- including programming languages and natural languages (sorta).  

It turns out that context-free grammars are highly relevant to the process of turning high-level source code (such as Java programs you might have written in CMS167) into machine code which the computer can actually execute.  You probably know this process as **compiling** some source code into a program.  Checking to see if a program is syntactically correct is an example use of a context-free grammar, and you'll begin to work on implementing this process during this sprint.

   * Textbook reading: For this sprint, you should read both as FoC contains significantly more information on CFGs, but doesn't contain anything on ambiguous grammars. 
      * FoC: Chapter 4.1-4.3
      * IToC: 2.1 (especially subsection on ambiguity, pgs. 105-106 in 2nd ed.)

# Reality Check:
  * On Tuesday, do basic team setup and introductions.  Do sprint planning meeting.  Work on syllabus worksheet.
  * TODO by next class:  Get Trello accounts and do Scrum reading. Skim worksheet and problem set, noting problems you have no idea where to start or are confused by.
  * Thursday class: Make sure everyone's on Trello.  Discuss the definitions of Scrum if there are any questions. Enter deliverables on Trello, categorize them into In-Progress and Backlog, and assign topics based on topics you had issues with.
  * TODO by next class: Read and work through textbook readings.  Do worksheet(s), focusing on areas you're having trouble with.  Complete the syllabus quiz.
  * Tuesday: Check worksheet and syllabus quiz & make sure everyone understands. Start problem sets together. Check/Ask professor for help if you're stuck.  Play game together.
  * TODO by Thursday: Have "almost final" answers for all problems in problem set.  Some may still need group discussion or further clarification.
  * Thursday: Do final check of problem set.  Make sure problem set is neat, tidy, and meets guidelines.  Turn in your problem set at the end of class.
  * TODO before next class: Play review game if you haven't alreay. Take the practice quiz and check your answers.  Study as a group.  
  * Next Tuesday: Quiz (30 minutes), Sprint XXX retrospective, and Sprint XXX planning.

# Retrospective:
  * Complete this [sprint retrospective survey](https://rollins.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3rAIzhpHFYbIixf?course=mat310s20&sprint=3).  Each team member should complete a survey.
